# Welcome to the GIIS Tech Club DNS Hub! ðŸš€

Ready to dive into the world of DNS and help shape the infrastructure of giistech.club? Whether you're a tech enthusiast or a curious explorer, this is your chance to make a tangible impact with just a few clicks. By tweaking a YAML file and opening a pull request, you'll set the wheels in motion, automatically updating our DNS records with Cloudflare. Let's get started!

## Why DNS?

DNS (Domain Name System) is like the internet's phonebook, translating human-readable domain names into IP addresses. It's crucial for:

- **Website Hosting**: Directing domain names to server IPs so visitors can reach your website.
- **Email Routing**: Ensuring emails reach the right destination through MX records.
- **Service Discovery**: Helping applications locate services through SRV records.
- **Security**: Using TXT records for configurations like SPF to protect email authenticity.

- Add or modify records using this structure:

  ```yaml
  subdomain:
    ttl: <TTL value in seconds>
    type: <Record type (A, CNAME, MX, etc.)>
    value: <Record value>
    octodns:
      cloudflare:
        proxied: <true/false>
        auto_ttl: <true/false>
  ```

  **Example - A Record:**

  ```yaml
  example:
    ttl: 60
    type: A
    value: 203.0.113.0
    octodns:
      cloudflare:
        proxied: true
        auto_ttl: true
  ```

  type: A
  value: 203.0.113.0
  octodns:
    cloudflare:
      proxied: true
      auto_ttl: true
```

### CNAME Record

```yaml
alias:
  ttl: 300
  type: CNAME
  value: target.domain.com.
  octodns:
    cloudflare:
      proxied: false
      auto_ttl: true
```
